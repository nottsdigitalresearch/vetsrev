  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>The objectives were to use meta-analytic methods to determine the effects of changes in dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) prepartum on productive performance and health of dairy cows. The literature was systematically reviewed, searching randomized experiments with transition cows that manipulated the prepartum DCAD or experiments with acidogenic diets in which dietary Ca, P, or Mg was manipulated. Forty-two experiments, including 134 treatment means and 1,803 cows, were included in the meta-analysis. Of those, 5 experiments with 15 treatment means reported responses for 151 nulliparous cows. Data collected included the mineral composition of prepartum diets, parity group prepartum, breed, days on treatment, and means and respective measure of variance for urine pH, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight, body condition, productive performance, concentrations of minerals and metabolites in blood, and incidence of diseases. Mixed effects meta-analyses were conducted weighting by the inverse of standard error of the means squared to account for the precision of each experiment. Models include the effects of DCAD, parity group prepartum, interaction between DCAD and parity group, and other covariates that showed significance in univariable analysis. Final models were selected based on parsimony and model fit. Reducing the prepartum DCAD reduced intake prepartum but improved intake postpartum in both parity groups. Interactions between DCAD and parity group occurred for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk (FCM), fat, and protein because reducing the DCAD improved those responses in parous cows; however, reducing the DCAD either had no effect on yields of milk and protein or reduced the yield of FCM and fat in nulliparous cows. The resulting equations from the statistical models predicted that reducing the DCAD from +200 to -100 mEq/kg would increase blood total Ca on the day of calving from 1.86 to 2.04 ± 0.05 mM, DMI postpartum 1.0 kg/d, and milk yield 1.7 kg/d in parous cows. The increased concentrations of blood total Ca at calving and postpartum explained the marked reduction in risk of milk fever in parous cows with a reduction in DCAD. As the DCAD decreased, the risk of retained placenta and metritis also decreased, resulting in fewer disease events per cow in both nulliparous and parous cows. Dietary concentrations of Ca, P, or Mg prepartum had no effect on DMI or yields of milk and FCM; however, increasing dietary Ca within the study range of 0.16 to 1.98% of dry matter tended to increase the risk of milk fever in parous cows regardless of DCAD fed. Collectively, results support the recommendation of prepartum acidogenic diets to result in a negative DCAD to parous cows with improvements in lactation performance and reduced risk of diseases; however, the range of DCAD fed did not allow for detection of an optimum value for postpartum performance. On the other hand, despite improvements in blood concentrations of Ca and reduction in uterine diseases with a reduction in DCAD fed to nulliparous cows, productive performance was either depressed or unaffected and the limited number of experiments did not provide sufficient evidence for a recommended DCAD for this group of cows.</p>
