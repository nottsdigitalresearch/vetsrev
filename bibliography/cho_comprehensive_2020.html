  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alopecia is a chronic condition that may cause emotional and psychological distress to patients, which may significantly impact a patientâ€™s quality of life. As conventional treatments have only a transient therapeutic effect and result in unwanted side effects, many patients have attempted to find therapeutic herbs or compounds that function as safer and more potent treatments for alopecia. Many such herbs have been used in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for centuries; however, there is a lack of information on the therapeutic mechanisms of herbs used for the treatment of alopecia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this review was to perform a critical assessment of the methods and results of experimental studies related to alopecia and to provide the potential mechanisms of action of herbs and their constituent compounds used in the identified studies, in particular, in relation to the stages of the cell cycle. We hope to better guide the clinical application and scientific research of herbs for the treatment of alopecia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed experimental studies to determine the methods used and the mechanism of action of the herbs and constituent compounds. Databases, including Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, OASIS, and RISS, were searched for the following keywords: "medicinal plants," "alopecia," "alopecia areata," "androgenetic alopecia," "animal experiment," and "in vitro study." We also assessed the risks of bias, toxicity, and taxonomy to determine the quality of information. RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice and human dermal papilla cells were the most commonly used models for in vivo and in vitro studies, respectively. Many herbs and their constituent compounds were used to treat alopecia by managing the hair cycle, keratinocyte proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, hormones, and inflammation. These compounds prolong the anagen phase, shorten the transition from the telogen to phase anagen, and inhibit premature catagen phase. CONCLUSIONS: This review has further elucidated the therapeutic mechanisms of herbs and their constituent compounds that are relevant to alopecia and discussed the effectiveness of using herbal treatments. There is a need to develop evidence regarding the quality control, taxonomy, and toxicology of these compounds. Such improvements will provide a better quality of evidence to ensure the efficacy and safety of herbs and compounds used for the treatment of alopecia.</p>
