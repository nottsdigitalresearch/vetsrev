  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>This study evaluated pasture traits and cattle performance in silvopastoral systems (SPSs) with Eucalyptus spp. and Urochloa spp. through a systematic review and meta-analysis. Systematic searches of databases, scientific journals and references of selected articles found 2,639 articles, of which 29 (120 comparisons) were selected. Comparisons were classified according to the covariates of distance between tree rows, number of trees/ha, tree planting orientation, system age and forage type. Data were submitted to meta-regression followed by subgroup analysis for covariates with a significant effect (P \textless 0.05) on the response. Data were analyzed in random effects models using mean difference and 95% confidence interval (P \textless 0.05). Forage mass (FM) was greater for SPSs with up to 99 trees/ha and lower for the other groups, compared to that for grass monoculture. Forage accumulation (FA) was also greater for SPSs with up to 99 trees/ha, but lower for SPSs with more than 300 trees/ha, compared to that for grass monoculture. FM was lower for SPSs of all spacings between tree rows and planting orientations, compared to that for grass monoculture, with the lowest being with smaller spacing and with north-south planting orientation. FA was lower for SPSs with up to 28m between tree rows, compared to that for grass monoculture, while that for SPSs with more than 28m did not differ. Neutral detergent fiber concentration was lower and crude protein greater for SPSs compared to grass monoculture, while lignin was greater and in vitro dry matter digestibility did not differ, which indicated no significant improvement in nutritive value in SPSs. Average daily gain was greater in SPSs with up to 99 trees/ha, and lower in those with more than 400 trees/ha, than in grass monoculture, with other subgroups not differing. Total weight gain per area (GHA) was lower in SPSs with less than 28m between tree rows or with more than 199 trees/ha, but greater in SPSs with more than 28m or with up to 99 trees/ha, compared to grass monoculture. GHA was lower in SPSs with a north-south orientation compared to grass monoculture, but those with an east-west orientation did not differ. The use of U. brizantha cv. Marandu and an east-west planting orientation are efficient strategies in maintaining FM, FA and GHA. GHA was greater in SPSs with more than 28m between tree rows and with up to 99 trees/ha, than in grass monoculture, which may facilitate the implementation of these SPSs in commercial farms.</p>
