  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Incomplete luteal regression after treatment with a single dose of PGF(2α) during an Ovsynch protocol decreases fertility to timed artificial insemination (AI). An additional treatment with PGF(2α) 24 h after the first dose has been recommended to increase the proportion of cows with complete luteal regression and subsequent pregnancy per AI (P/AI). This is, however, associated with additional costs of labor and product. The objective was to develop a stochastic partial budget model to estimate the economic impact of an additional PGF(2α) treatment on d 8 during an Ovsynch protocol in primiparous and multiparous cows. A systematic review of the literature and a meta-analytical assessment was performed to evaluate the effects of adding a second PGF(2α) treatment during the Ovsynch protocol on P/AI in lactating dairy cows. Thirteen randomized controlled experiments from 11 published manuscripts including 9,735 cows were used. We were able to retrieve information regarding parity from 9 experiments from 7 manuscripts (2,367 primiparous cows and 5,356 multiparous cows). An additional dose of PGF(2α) yielded a 5.60 risk difference in P/AI [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.69-7.52]. In primiparous cows and multiparous cows, an additional dose of PGF(2α) yielded a 4.24 (95% CI = 0.31-8.17) and a 5.31 risk difference in P/AI (95% CI = 2.75-7.87). Revenue was based on the associated improvement in reproductive performance because of an increase in P/AI multiplied by the value of a pregnancy (PGVAL). Median PGVAL was €252, ranging from €42 (fifth percentile) to €623 (95th percentile). Based on parity, median PGVAL was €205 (5th percentile = €43; 95th percentile = €651) and €264 (5th percentile = €88; 95th percentile = €598) for primiparous (n = 1,252) and multiparous cows (n = 3,003), respectively. Using a stochastic simulation model with 10,000 iterations, adding a second PGF(2α) dose on d 8 was more profitable (€7.76/cow; 5th percentile = €0.01; 95th percentile = €29.40) compared with a single PGF(2α) administration on d 7. In primiparous cows, adding a second PGF(2α) treatment was more profitable (€1.99/cow; 5th percentile = -€3.08; 95th percentile = €22.52) in 67% of all simulated iterations. In multiparous cows, adding a second PGF(2α) treatment was more profitable (€7.92/cow; 5th percentile = -€0.09; 95th percentile = €28.22) in 95% of all simulated iterations. In conclusion, there was a clear benefit of an additional PGF(2α) treatment during the Ovsynch protocol on P/AI (+5.6 percentage units). Despite additional costs for hormones and labor, an additional treatment with PGF(2α) on d 8 was more profitable in 95% of all scenarios because of the associated increase in fertility. It turned out, however, that adding a second PGF(2α) treatment was more profitable in multiparous cows compared with primiparous cows.</p>
