  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury significantly contribute to the burden of end-stage renal disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially for stem/progenitor cell-derived EVs (stem/progenitor cell-EVs), have emerged as a promising therapy for ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI. However, their regulatory effects remain poorly understood, and their therapeutic efficiency in clinical trials is controversial. Here, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the stem/progenitor cell-EV efficacy in treating ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI in preclinical rodent models. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify controlled studies about the therapeutic efficiency of stem/progenitor cell-EVs on ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI rodent models. The level of SCr, an indicator of renal function, was regarded as the primary outcome. Meta-regression analysis was used to reveal the influential factors of EV therapy. Sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, and assessment of publication bias were also performed in our systematic review and meta-analysis. A standardized mean difference (SMD) was used as the common effect size between stem/progenitor cell-EV-treated and control groups, with values of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 defined as small, medium, large, and very large effect sizes, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 30 studies with 985 ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI rodent models were included. The pooled results showed that EV injection could lead to a remarkable sCr reduction compared with the control group (SMD, - 3.47; 95%CI, - 4.15 to - 2.80; P \textless 0.001). Meanwhile, the EV treatment group had lower levels of BUN (SMD, - 3.60; 95%CI, - 4.25 to - 2.94; P \textless 0.001), indexes for tubular and endothelial injury, renal fibrosis (fibrosis score and α-SMA), renal inflammation (TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, and CD68 + macrophages), but higher levels of indexes for tubular proliferation, angiogenesis-related VEGF, and reactive oxygen species. However, our meta-regression analysis did not identify significant associations between sCr level and cell origins of EVs, injection doses, delivery routes, and therapy and outcome measurement time (all P values \textgreater 0.05). Significant publication bias was observed (Egger’s test, P \textless 0.001). CONCLUSION: Stem/progenitor cell-EVs are effective in improving renal function in rodent ischemia/reperfusion injury-induced AKI model. These vesicles may help (i) reduce cell apoptosis and stimulate cell proliferation, (ii) ameliorate inflammatory injury and renal fibrosis, (iii) promote angiogenesis, and (iv) inhibit oxidative stress. However, the current systematic review and meta-analysis did not identify significant influential factors associated with treatment effects. More preclinical studies and thoughtfully designed animal studies are needed in the future.</p>
