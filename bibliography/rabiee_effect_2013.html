  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of internal teat sealant products containing bismuth subnitrate (Teatseal and Orbeseal; Pfizer Animal Health, West Ryde, Australia) when used alone, or in the presence of antibiotic dry cow therapy (ADCT), before or at drying off on the incidence of new intramammary infections (IMI), clinical mastitis, and milk somatic cell count (SCC) during lactation. The literature search identified 18 English-language publications on the use of Teatseal in dairy cattle. A total of 12 studies with 17 subtrials or comparisons including 13 positive control subtrials (internal teat sealant and ADCT vs. ADCT) and 4 negative control subtrials (internal teat sealant vs. untreated) examining IMI were included in the analysis. Internal teat sealants, alone or in the presence of ADCT, reduced the risk of acquiring new IMI after calving by 25% [risk ratio (RR)=0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67 to 0.83]. Internal teat sealants reduced the risk of IMI by 73% compared with untreated cows (RR=0.27; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.55). The results of both meta-analyses of IMI, with positive and negative controls, were heterogeneous [I(2) (a statistic that describes the proportion of total variation in study effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity)=65.4 and 92.1%]. No farm or cow factors studied significantly contributed to the heterogeneity of the results. A total of 16 studies (21 subtrials), including 14 positive control subtrials and 7 negative control subtrials, examining clinical mastitis were included in the analysis. Internal teat sealants alone and in the presence of ADCT reduced the risk of clinical mastitis after calving in lactating cows by 29% (RR=0.71; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.82), and 48% (RR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.37 to 0.75), respectively. The results of the meta-analysis on clinical mastitis with positive controls were homogeneous (I(2)=33.6%), whereas the results of studies with negative controls were heterogeneous (I(2)=60.4%). No farm or cow factors studied that had sufficient data to evaluate significantly contributed to the heterogeneity of the results. The estimated linear score (LS) of milk SCC after calving in published studies (n=3) and for studies that provided raw data (n=2), was significantly lower for cattle treated with internal teat sealants and ADCT in 3 studies than for cattle treated with internal teat sealants only. The estimated LS of pooled raw data of 3 studies from 32 herds showed that the LS of cows treated with internal teat sealant and ADCT was not significantly different than those treated with ADCT only. This study found that the application of internal teat sealants in the presence of ADCT or the use of internal teat sealants alone at dry off significantly reduced the incidence of IMI and clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows compared with respective control groups. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of internal teat sealants on postpartum milk SCC in lactating dairy cows.</p>
