  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD) is a worldwide multifactorial infectious disease. Antimicrobials are commonly used for treating BRD because bacteria are often involved. The clinical diagnosis of BRD is a challenge, especially in adult dairy cows, where information on this syndrome is scant. Having a definition based on consistent and reliable clinical signs would improve the accuracy of BRD diagnosis and could help to develop an optimal treatment approach by an early detection. The aim of this scoping review was to review clinical signs that could be recognized by producers in dairy cattle suffering from naturally occurring infectious respiratory disease, as reported in the literature. A review of the literature was performed for articles published between January 1, 1990 and January 1, 2020. The search of literature in English, French, and Italian languages included 2 different databases (Pubmed, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; CAB abstract, https://www.cabi.org/publishing-products/cab-abstracts/). Clinical signs were categorized as follows: (1) "general manifestations of disease," which included behavioral changes or fever; (2) "alterations in respiratory function," which included clinical signs specifically associated with the respiratory tract examination; and (3) "clinical signs of other body systems," which included clinical signs related to other systems such as diarrhea or subcutaneous emphysema. The focus of the review was on clinical signs that could be monitored by animal handlers and producers. A total of 1,067 titles were screened, and 23 studies were finally included. The most common general clinical signs were increased body temperature (reported in 83% of studies, n = 19), change in feed intake (26%, n = 6), altered mentation (22%, n = 5), and decreased milk production (17%, n = 4). The alterations in respiratory function noted were nasal discharge (74%, n = 17), cough (65%, n = 15), altered respiratory dynamic or dyspnea (61%, n = 14), increased respiratory rate (43%, n = 10), and ocular discharge or lacrimation (30%, n = 7). The clinical signs associated with infectious respiratory disease reported in the 23 studies generally lacked a clear description of what constitutes a deviation from normality (0-50% of studies clearly reported what was considered normal versus abnormal depending on the clinical signs). This limitation prevented any comparison between studies that apparently reported the same "clinical sign," but possibly referred to a different assessment and definition of what was considered normal versus abnormal. Therefore, the definition of clinical signs in a repeatable way with validated interobserver agreement to determine the optimal combination for the diagnosis of BRD in dairy cows is needed. This could lead to a more judicious use of antimicrobials for respiratory disease in adult dairy cows.</p>
