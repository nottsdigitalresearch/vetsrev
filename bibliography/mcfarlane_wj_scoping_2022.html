  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Nonambulatory dairy cattle pose a complex problem due to the challenges associated with prevention, appropriate treatment and management, and arriving at an accurate prognosis. There is a breadth of literature regarding this topic, of which there is currently no formal synthesis. The objective of this scoping review was to describe and characterize the literature investigating risk factors, sequela, preventions, treatments, and prognostic factors for nonambulatory conditions in dairy cattle, with the intent of qualitatively synthesizing knowledge of the topic and identifying gaps in the literature. A literature search was conducted in 6 databases and 2 conference proceeding archives, which returned 7,568 unique articles. Initial screening of abstracts resulted in 1,544 articles reviewed at the full-text stage, of which 379 were included for data extraction. Over 75% of the included literature was published after 1980, and the most common countries in which these studies took place were the United States (n = 72), Canada (18), Sweden (17), and Germany (17). Common eligibility criteria used for inclusion were geographic region (97) and parity (92). Of the 379 studies included in this review, 144 were randomized controlled trials and 235 were observational studies. The majority of the controlled trials assessed prevention of nonambulatory conditions (116), most commonly through supplementation of vitamin D (27) and calcium (25) or the provision of anionic salts (22). Of the 28 studies focusing on treatment of nonambulatory conditions, 26 focused on calcium administration. Becoming nonambulatory was evaluated as an outcome in 165 of the observational studies. Frequently measured risk factors for becoming nonambulatory included hematological variables, such as blood calcium (73), phosphorus (53) and magnesium (42), and other factors such as parity (35) and breed (22). Recovery from a nonambulatory condition was the outcome in 31 of the observational studies, with commonly measured prognostic indicators being calcium (9), phosphorus (9), and duration of recumbency (7). Nonambulatory disorders were measured as risk factors in 53 of the observational studies, with the most commonly assessed outcomes including disorders of the transition period (11), and death or euthanasia (11). The most common terms used to describe nonambulatory conditions were "milk fever" (199) and "parturient paresis" (147). These terms were only further defined with explicit symptomatic criteria in 193 of the 379 studies in this review. Recumbency was the most commonly used of these criteria (144), followed by inability to rise (55). Potential gaps in the literature concerning nonambulatory dairy cattle that were identified in the present review included investigation of prognostic indicators for recovery from nonambulatory conditions that are applicable on farm, treatment alternatives to calcium administration, and guidance regarding the appropriate usage of terms meant to categorize nonambulatory dairy cattle.</p>
