  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an important cause of feline morbidity and mortality. There is currently no agreement on which outcomes are most important in CKD treatment trials to assist evidence-based decision making. Core Outcome Sets (COSs) originated in human healthcare and are an agreed set of outcomes to be measured and reported as a minimum in any trial conducted relating to a particular disease. To establish a COS for feline CKD, this study used a systematic review and two consensus methodologies (an electronic Delphi (eDelphi), and an in-person consensus meeting), with an international panel of key stakeholders. The systematic review identified 104 unique published parameters, which were rated by panellists in round 1 of the eDelphi. Panellists were also asked to suggest additional parameters. In round 2 these additional parameters were rated and any parameters not understood by \textgreater10 % of panellists in round 1 were redefined and re-rated. Parameters reaching consensus in rounds 1 and 2 were removed from round 3, when all remaining parameters were re-rated by panellists who could view their own previous rating alongside the median rating of the whole panel. To reach inclusion in the COS, parameters had to be rated 8 or 9 on a Likert scale of 1-9 (where 1 was not important and 9 was very important) by more than 80 % of panellists. In the consensus meeting, panellists discussed and re-rated borderline parameters and streamlined the final COS. Borderline parameters were those that had been closest to, but not achieved, the 80 % threshold for inclusion. The eDelphi panel (n = 73) rated 24/104 parameters highly enough for inclusion and proposed an additional 20 parameters, of which 3 reached the inclusion threshold. This totalled 27 parameters for inclusion. The consensus meeting panel (n = 16) rated an additional 6/20 borderline parameters highly enough for inclusion. During the streamlining process, 4 parameters were removed as one was considered not an outcome, and three were already addressed by other parameters. The remaining COS totalled 29 parameters. These were grouped into 9 core themes: clinical examination, quality of life, serum biochemistry, complete blood count, urinalysis, total amount of food eaten, CKD progression, survival time and cause of death. This is the first COS for feline medicine. In future treatment efficacy trials the COS will strengthen the evidence-base for this condition, by facilitating easier comparison of results between studies, and reduce research waste.</p>
