  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Clinical mastitis (CM) is one of the most frequent and costly diseases in dairy cows. A frustrating aspect of CM is its recurrent nature. This review was conducted to synthesize knowledge on risk of repeated cases of CM, effects of recurrent CM cases, and risk factors for CM recurrence. A systematic review methodology was used to identify articles for this narrative review. Searches were performed to identify relevant scientific literature published after 1989 in English or French from 2 databases (PubMed and CAB Abstracts) and 1 search platform (Web of Science). Fifty-seven manuscripts were selected for qualitative synthesis according to the inclusion criteria. Among the 57 manuscripts selected in this review, a description of CM recurrence, its risk factors, and effects were investigated and reported in 33, 37, and 19 selected manuscripts, respectively. Meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were used to compute risk ratio comparing risk of CM in cows that already had 1 CM event in the current lactation with risk of CM in healthy cows. For these analyses, 9 manuscripts that reported the total number of lactations followed and the number of lactations with ≤1 and ≤2 CM cases were used. When summarizing results from studies requiring ≥5 d between CM events to consider a CM event as a new case, we observed no significant change in CM susceptibility following a first CM case (risk ratio: 0.99; 95% confidence interval: 0.86-1.14). However, for studies using a more liberal CM recurrence definition (i.e., only 24 h between CM events to consider new CM cases), we observed a 1.54 times greater CM risk (95% confidence interval: 1.20-1.97) for cows that already had 1 CM event in the current lactation compared with healthy cows. The most important risk factors for CM recurrence were parity (i.e., higher risk in older cows), a higher milk production, pathogen species involved in the preceding case, and whether a bacteriological cure was observed following the preceding case. The most important effects of recurrent CM were the milk yield reduction following a recurrent CM case, which was reported to be similar to that of the first CM case, and the increased risk of culling and mortality, which were reported to surpass those of first CM cases.</p>
